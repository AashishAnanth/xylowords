# About
Learning the English language isn’t easy, and it often isn’t fun. With the allure of screens, it isn’t easy to get students excited about reading. Portflo aims to gamify English learning by adding timing and wagering features, ensuring students challenge themselves with tougher stakes and regularly practice through spaced repetition.

# Requirements
This app was built as part of FBLA's Mobile Application Development event for 2024/25. Our project meets the requirements in [this rubric](https://connect.fbla.org/headquarters/files/High%20School%20Competitive%20Events%20Resources/Individual%20Guidelines/Presentation%20Events/Mobile-Application-Development.pdf).
- Users can easily navigate between pages through our use of Stack and Tab navigators in React Native
- User interface is intuitive and instructions are placed to direct users when necessary
- Icons have been designed to fit with the theme of the app
- All user input is validated in both syntactical and semantic levels
- The app is fully integrated with Twitter so users can brag about their achievements.

# Technologies Used
- [Expo](https://expo.dev) to securely store the user's data and manage the app's deployment
- [React Native](https://reactnative.dev) for the app's code, using both built-in and external libraries
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) to style the app's components with efficient short-form classes
- [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org) to leverage static typing and store key user statistics
- All dependencies used can be found in `package.json`

# Planning
